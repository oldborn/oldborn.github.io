The first game that we developed in Aggressive Lamb Games Org. Although it is a basic arcade space game for mobile, it thought me so much. For instance, I did not know that how much effort was needed for fine adjustments. We spend the almost same amount of time on final touches as the total core development. Integration to the markets (App Store and Google Play), to the ad networks, was awful at the time when we developed the game. We did the almost all the recommendations for a mobile game such as; no-add in-app purchase, custom skins, achievements, leaderboard, youtube video, etc. Although the game is not currently live in any stores, I will always remember it since it was my first.
