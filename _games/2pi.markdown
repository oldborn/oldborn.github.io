    2pi or with its full name '2π: Can you make it?', is another game that I developed for google play. The time when I developed the game 'aa' was a big hit, and everybody wanted to jump into the hypercasual era. Like all of the new game developers at that time, I also published one hypercasual game.

    Now when I looked at it, I remember how fun was to implement it. But, I am not proud of my intentions. Video games should not be a tool for getting rich quickly. Well, almost four years passed since I first released the 2pi. It is not in the store anymore, and I already left the hypercasual train.
